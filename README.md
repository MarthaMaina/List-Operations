# Python List Operations

This repository provides a Python script demonstrating several fundamental operations on lists. It is designed as a learning resource for anyone seeking to understand and practice common list manipulations in Python.

## Features

The script demonstrates the following operations:
- **Initialization**: Create an empty list.
- **Appending Elements**: Add multiple elements to the end of the list.
- **Inserting Elements**: Insert an element at a specific position.
- **Extending List**: Append elements from another list.
- **Removing Elements**: Remove the last element from the list.
- **Sorting**: Sort the list in ascending order.
- **Finding Index**: Locate and print the index of a specific value.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation & Running
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MarthaMaina/List-Operations.git
   cd List-Operations
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   python list_operations.py
   ```
   *(Assuming the file is named `list_operations.py`.)*

The script will print the state of the list after each operation to your console.

## Example Output
```
1. Initial empty list: []
2. After appending elements: [10, 20, 30, 40]
3. After inserting 15 at second position: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
4. After extending with [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
5. After removing the last element (70): [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
6. After sorting in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
7. The index of value 30 is: 3
```

# Python List Operations
This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates various fundamental operations on lists. It's designed as a learning exercise to showcase how to manipulate lists in Python using common built-in methods.
# Features
This script performs the following operations on a Python list:
a) Initialization: Creates an empty list.
b) Appending Elements: Adds multiple elements to the end of the list.
c) Inserting Elements: Inserts an element at a specific position.
d) Extending List: Appends elements from another list.
e) Removing Elements: Removes the last element from the list.
f) Sorting: Sorts the list in ascending order.
g) Finding Index: Locates and prints the index of a specific value.
# How to Run
To run this Python script, you will need Python 3 installed on your system.
1. Clone the repository (or download the file):
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with your actual GitHub username and the name of your new repository.)
2. Execute the script:
python list_operations.py
(Assuming you named the Python file list_operations.py)
The script will then print the state of the list after each operation to your console.
# Example Output
1. Initial empty list: []
2. After appending elements: [10, 20, 30, 40]
3. After inserting 15 at second position: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
4. After extending with [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
5. After removing the last element (70): [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
6. After sorting in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
7. The index of value 30 is: 3
